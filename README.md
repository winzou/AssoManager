========================

What's that?
--------------

AssoManager is an early-stage project which aims to provide a simple yet powerful IT system to French Association Loi 1901.

Contribution
---------------------

As the project is not started yet, and is still in conception stage, contributors interested in it should wait till I release a first shot.
